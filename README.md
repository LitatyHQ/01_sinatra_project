Welcome to Therapy with Ease!

I wanted to create an application that will be able to add to what many people struggle with and ease them into finding the help they need without feeling the pressure to do so. My web application works like a third party website that focuses on setting appointments to facilitate the needs of the clients and for the company that will use the appointments made to reach the client.

My website is user friendly with a minimalistic style to have a great customer experience. Even with the simplicity of my code, I had challenges of using helper methods to connect my controllers and views to each other. I am pleased to say I kept trying different methods until I found a great flow that worked for my application and my personal style.

I would love to share this experience with you!
